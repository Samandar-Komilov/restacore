Congrats! You can now start using the application!


## Compilation and Execution on hand
After setting up the project, if you need, you can check Makefile so that you'll understand the following commands are used to compile client and server programs:

Client process compilation:
```
gcc `pkg-config --cflags gtk+-3.0` src/client.c src/client_functions.c -o build/client `pkg-config --libs gtk+-3.0` -lpthread
```


Server process compilation:
```
gcc src/server.c src/server_functions.c -o build/server -I/usr/include/postgresql -L/usr/lib -lpq -lpthread
```

So that's all, enjoy!!!
